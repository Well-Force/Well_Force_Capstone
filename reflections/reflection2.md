## Reflection Questions

* Name at least one successful thing this week.

We were able to display personalized meals, display recommended snacks on the dashboard, and complete all of the core features for the MVP by thursday.

* What were some challenges you and/or your group faced this week?

We faced some challenges with deployment, media queries for responsive layouts, and git merge conflicts.

* Did you finish all of your tasks in your sprint plan for this week? If you did not finish all of the planned tasks, how would you prioritize the remaining tasks on your list?  (i.e over planned, did not know how to implement certain features, miscommunication from the team, had to pivot from original plans, etc.)

We did yes, we were able to implement and complete our core features. Only thing is that it is buggy so we need to fix those bugs, but we were able to complete the items in our sprint this week.

* Did the resources provided to you help prepare you in planning and executing your capstone project sprint this week? Be specific, what resources did you find particularly helpful or which tasks did you need more support on?

Yes, we kept in mind SMART goals and worked off of our previous sprint planning to plan the sprint this week.

* Which features and user stories would you consider “at risk”? How will you change your plan if those items remain “at risk”?

We do not consider any features or user stories at risk as they just have a couple of bugs that need to be fixed, nothing that won't be fixed by next Friday.
