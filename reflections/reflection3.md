## Reflection Questions

* Name at least one successful thing this week.

 This week, a significant success was the implementation of a new calorie tracker for meals and snacks, which now allows users to monitor their intake effectively. Another notable achievement was Janine's work on addressing the "unhappy routes" within the application, ensuring a smoother and more reliable experience even when things don't go as planned.

* What were some challenges you and/or your group faced this week?

 Our team faced a few challenges this week, including some UI bugs that popped up during deployment. We also had to troubleshoot issues with the profile picture not appearing next to a user's name and the correct images for snacks or meals not displaying. Another hurdle was the need to reload the page to see updates, which we're currently working to fix.

* Did you finish all of your tasks in your sprint plan for this week? If you did not finish all of the planned tasks, how would you prioritize the remaining tasks on your list?  (i.e over planned, did not know how to implement certain features, miscommunication from the team, had to pivot from original plans, etc.)

 We finished all of our planned tasks this week, but some new issues and smaller tasks popped up as we progressed. These new tasks include small UI fixes and addressing the page reloading issue. We will prioritize these remaining tasks in our next sprint, focusing first on the user experience improvements like the UI fixes and the page reloading bug, as these directly impact the usability of the application.

* Did the resources provided to you help prepare you in planning and executing your capstone project sprint this week? Be specific, what resources did you find particularly helpful or which tasks did you need more support on?

 The mentors and instructors were particularly helpful this week, especially when it came to the demo and documentation. We also found the documentation for the specific languages we were using to be very useful in implementing our features. We specifically needed more support on the deployment and UI aspects of the project, which the mentors were able to guide us through.

* Which features and user stories would you consider “at risk”? How will you change your plan if those items remain “at risk”?

 We don't consider any features or user stories to be "at risk" at this time. However, there are some areas that need attention, such as the shifting between pages and small UI fixes. Our plan is to dedicate time in the next sprint to address these issues, ensuring a smoother user experience and a more polished final product. We will prioritize these UI and navigation fixes to ensure the application is seamless and easy to use.
