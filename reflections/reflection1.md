## Reflection Questions

* Name at least one successful thing this week.

We were able to complete two user stories. 1) The user can sign up and set their profile/preferences. 2) The user can prompt the AI companion and receive a response. 

* What were some challenges you and/or your group faced this week?

 We faced a couple of challenges with styling when implementing the navigation bar and connecting the Clerk Authentication frontend and backend. 

* Did you finish all of your tasks in your sprint plan for this week? If you did not finish all of the planned tasks, how would you prioritize the remaining tasks on your list?  (i.e over planned, did not know how to implement certain features, miscommunication from the team, had to pivot from original plans, etc.)

 Yes, we were able to complete the tasks that fit the user stories that we wanted to complete this week.

* Did the resources provided to you help prepare you in planning and executing your capstone project sprint this week? Be specific, what resources did you find particularly helpful or which tasks did you need more support on?

Yes, we found the trello board to be helpful in planning.

* Which features and user stories would you consider “at risk”? How will you change your plan if those items remain “at risk”?

We consider our recommendations story to be at risk as we still need to implement the AI, backend, and frontend aspect of that specific feature. We plan to work this weekend to get a head start and then be able to submit the best version of our project.
