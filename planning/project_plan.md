## Problem Statement and Description

Despite Salesforce’s strong investment in employee wellbeing, many employees are unaware of available benefits or unsure how to use them. This project proposes a personalized wellbeing platform called Wellforce, helping Salesforce employees easily discover and use their benefits through tailored suggestions and an AI Companion that simplifies access to meals, physical wellness, and other resources.


## User Roles and Personas

      - A Salesforce Software Engineer on the Slack Team looking to view a daily list of healthy snack options available in the office, so that they can make better nutritional choices during their workday.
      - An FTL SWE intern they want to browse a guide of all available office snacks and drinks, so they can take advantage of what's available during their short time here
3. Admin - Employee who can edit the snacks available
      - A Salesforce employee in charge of snacks want to add a new seasonal snack available.
      - A Salesforce employee wants to remove a snack that is no longer available.
